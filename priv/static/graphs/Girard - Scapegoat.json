When individuals or groups desire the same object, conflict becomes inevitable. To resolve this chaos, societies often project their collective tensions onto a scapegoat, whose expulsion or sacrifice restores order. This mechanism not only explains the origins of social cohesion but also exposes the hidden violence that underpins cultural and religious rituals. By identifying this pattern, Girard provides a powerful lens for understanding the cyclical nature of conflict and reconciliation in human history.",

We desire objects not because of their intrinsic value, but because others desire them. This imitation of desire leads to rivalry, as multiple individuals or groups compete for the same object, status, or goal.\n\nKey points about mimetic desire:\n1. **Non-originality of desire**: Our desires are shaped by others, often unconsciously.\n2. **Escalation of rivalry**: When two or more parties desire the same thing, conflict arises, intensifying as each tries to outdo the other.\n3. **Triangular structure**: Desire involves a subject, an object, and a mediator (the person or model whose desire is being imitated).\n4. **Social contagion**: Mimetic desire spreads through communities, creating shared aspirations and tensions.\n\nGirard argues that this dynamic is universal and underlies much of human conflict, from personal rivalries to large-scale societal violence. The scapegoat mechanism emerges as a way to resolve these tensions, but it does so at the cost of perpetuating cycles of violence and exclusion.",

Additionally, Girard's theory assumes a uniformity in how societies resolve conflict, ignoring the possibility of non-violent or cooperative solutions.
