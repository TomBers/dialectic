E2E Testing:

Headed vs headless
- Your base scripts default to headless. To launch a visible browser, use the headed variants I added:
  - npm run e2e:structured:headed
  - npm run e2e:creative:headed

2) Targeting a specific test file
- The scripts already pass a specific test path to Playwright:
  - e2e:structured runs tests/graph-exercise.spec.ts
  - e2e:creative runs tests/graph-exercise-creative.spec.ts
