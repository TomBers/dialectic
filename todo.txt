Placement and scope
  - Where should the mode selector live: on the chat toolbar next to the input, in settings, or per-conversation header?

  Lets place it in the right hand panel with a description and a smaller icon in the bottom toolbar that can be clicked to cycle the modes.

  - Should it apply per message, per conversation, or be a global user preference with an option to override per message?

  global user preference

- Modes and behavior
  - Do you have a predefined set of modes, or should I propose one? Example modes: Balanced (default), Concise, Structured (headings/steps), Conversational, Deep-dive, Socratic, Code-first, Creative/Exploratory.

  Lets go for - Balanced (default), Concise, Structured (headings/steps), Conversational, Deep-dive, Socratic, Creative/Exploratory

  - For each mode, should we only change the system prompt, or also tweak sampling params (temperature/top_p), max tokens, and verbosity defaults?

  Just the system prompts, unless you see a benefit of changing the other params

- Prompt plumbing
  - How is `llm_interface` currently structured? Does it accept a “system prompt” string and generation params, or do we need to extend its API?

  There should be a system prompt - check llm_interface.ex to check how it is done, prefer keeping the prompts separate if possible.

  - Should mode prompts be injected as a system message, a prefix to the user content, or merged into an existing system prompt template?

  What ever you suggest

- Persistence and defaults
  - What’s the default mode for new users/conversations?

  Balanced.

  - Should the selection persist across sessions (e.g., stored with user profile or conversation metadata), or reset each time?

Maybe as a session varible?

- Custom modes
  - Do you want users to define their own custom prompts/modes, or stick to a curated set for now?

  Curated

- UI/UX
  - Preferred control: dropdown, segmented control, or icons with tooltips?
  - Any copy/tone guidelines for mode names and descriptions?

Dropdown in the right hand menu, a cycling button in the bottom menu

Add labels back to the bottom toolbar
