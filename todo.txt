TODO -

First Public Demo (with Ronan)

Technical issues:

Must fix:
0) Add a view all option - Done
1) Fix Graph crash when multiple windows are open - Done
2) LLM response was sometimes mangled - see https://mudg.fly.dev/Should%2520Ireland%2520join%2520Nato
 -  (Improve debugability and consider swapping to OpenAI??)
3) Broadcast Graph changes to all connected clients
4) Cap map zoom level - Ronan kept zooming out too far

Further testing:

1) Some issue with Keyboard shortcuts on Windows - some sort of key lock


Gui improvements:

1) Make graph full screen and overlay the responses
2) Generate first response on Graph generation
3) Colour swap - Green - Pro, Red - Con, Blue answer
4) Node Context menu - add controls on the graph
5) Put summary of text in Node
6) Think about showing the text conversation in a Modal window


Use the system to have interesting conversations - does it help comprehension?
Ideas -
Being and Time,
German Idealism,
The Republic - Plato,
The Prince - Machiavelli,
The Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu,
Zen the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Pirsig,
Small is Beautiful - Schumacher,
The Art of War - Sun Tzu,





Ideas:

1) Personas - ask the LLM to answer the question as a particular thinker
Answer as Plato, Aristotle, etc.

2) An User inbox - where they can see queestions that they have not answered yet ?? Or maybe just a list of questions that they have asked.



Overview - a multiplayer where any player can answer questions.  The players are either real people online, or LLM agents.  The LLM agents are trained to answer questions as a particular thinker.
