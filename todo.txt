The bottom toolbar over runs the content panel, making it hard to read the content.  Make it respect sizing if either left hand and / or right hand menu is open

Don't show lock in right hand menu if action not possible

Now we have the right hand menu not always displayed, can simplify it, no need for drop downs inside.

Make center graph respect if the right hand menu is open or not
