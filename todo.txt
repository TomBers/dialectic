Flow and routing
- When creating a brand new graph (from “start new idea”), do you want to keep using the existing `/start/new/idea` entry point and simply redirect to `GraphLive` after creation? Or do you want a new entry point entirely?

Yes this should replace the existing flow.

- Should we keep `FocusLive` around for any use case, or fully move users away from it once this change is made?

Fully move users away/

Content panel behavior inside GraphLive
- Default mode: should the content panel default to “discrete” (as it currently is) or “conversation” by default?
For the time being default to conversation

- Scope of conversation: should the conversation rendering show the path from root to the currently selected node (like Focus), or something else (e.g., more siblings)?

Lets start simply, keep the same logic

- Toggle persistence: when a user switches between “Conversation” and “Discrete,” should that preference persist across node changes and sessions (e.g., store in session/localStorage), or just be per-view until refresh?

Persist

- Bottom input bar: should I remove the bottom chat input entirely and move all Q/A into the content panel? Or only hide it when the content panel is in “conversation” mode?
Yes move it entirely

- Input events: in the conversation mode inside GraphLive, should the input form trigger the existing GraphLive events (`reply-and-answer` and `answer`) rather than FocusLive’s (`send_message`/`form_change`)? I recommend standardizing on GraphLive events.
Good idea, keep the existinc conventions

UI/UX details
- In conversation mode, the conversation component in Focus has extra header and a “Back to graph” link. Since we’re already in graph view, do you want that header removed for the embedded content panel?

Remove them

- Where should the conversation/discrete toggle live in the panel (e.g., top-right of the content panel)? Any specific labels you prefer?

Maybe an icon that represents a conversation and a single item

- When streaming responses, should the conversation panel live-update the current node’s message (like Focus does) and scroll to the latest message? I can mirror the Focus stream behavior.

Yes please,

- Do you want the toolbar (actions like branch, deepdive, etc.) to remain where it is today (in the bottom menu), or also move a subset of those actions into the content panel?

Lets keep them where they are for the time being

Data and performance
- Conversation rendering needs the path to the current node. Are you okay with GraphLive computing and maintaining that path as the selected node changes?

Yes

- Any preference on how we track “sending” state and text state in GraphLive (mirroring `:sending_message` and `:message_text` that Focus uses)?

No
