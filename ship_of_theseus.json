If identity were solely tied to material composition, the ship would cease to be the same once all its parts are replaced. However, if identity is rooted in form, function, or continuity of existence, the ship remains the same despite material changes. This mirrors personal identity: while our cells, thoughts, and experiences change over time, the continuity of our consciousness and narrative sense of self suggests we remain the same person. Thus, the thought experiment highlights that identity may not depend on fixed material components but on a deeper, more abstract continuity.","class":"thesis"},{"id":"5","content":"The Ship of Theseus thought experiment challenges us to rethink identity by questioning whether it is tied to material composition, form, function, or continuity. If identity were solely based on material composition, the ship would lose its identity once all parts are replaced.

This mirrors personal identity: while our physical and mental states change over time, the continuity of consciousness and our narrative sense of self suggest we remain the same person. \n\nThe thought experiment also highlights the importance of *causal continuity* and *narrative identity*. Even if all parts of the ship are replaced, the incremental changes preserve a causal link between the original and the present ship. Similarly, personal identity is not just about physical continuity but the coherence of our experiences and memories, which form a continuous narrative. Thus, identity is better understood as a dynamic process, shaped by causal and narrative continuity, rather than a static property tied to unchanging material components.

It asks: If all parts of a ship are replaced over time, is it still the same ship? This raises questions about whether identity is tied to material composition or something more abstract, like form or function. It also connects to personal identity—if we change over time, are we still the same person?","class":"answer"},{"id":"4","content":"The Ship of Theseus challenges the notion of identity by focusing on material continuity, but it overlooks the role of *causal continuity* and *narrative identity*.
