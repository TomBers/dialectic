## Day 1: Learn the Product (You Can't Sell What You Don't Understand)

The entire first day is about becoming a power user. No marketing output yet — just depth.

### Morning

- [ ] **Create an account** on https://mudg.fly.dev and explore the interface freely for 30 minutes. Click everything. Break nothing (or try to).
- [ ] **Build your first map** on a topic you genuinely find interesting. Try every action at least once:
  - Create an origin node (paste in a question or claim)
  - Branch it (generates a thesis + antithesis)
  - Ask a follow-up question on a node
  - Deep dive on a node
  - Get related ideas
  - Combine two nodes into a synthesis
  - Try selecting text within a node and using the selection actions
- [ ] **Switch reading levels** — try the same topic at "simple", "high school", "university", and "expert" modes. Note the differences.

### Afternoon

- [ ] **Build a second map** — this time pick a currently trending or controversial topic (AI regulation, social media bans, university tuition, etc.). Go at least 4 levels deep.
- [ ] **Try collaboration** — share a map link and have someone else add to it (even if it's just you on a second browser/incognito tab).
- [ ] **Export a map** — try PDF, Markdown, and JSON export. See what the output looks like.
- [ ] **Write down your "aha moment"** — the point where the tool clicked for you. Also write down anything that confused you. Both are marketing gold.
- [ ] **Review the landing page** (`index.html`) and `promotion.md` — understand how the product is currently positioned.

### Deliverable

A short document (even bullet points) with:
1. Your honest first impressions — what's impressive, what's confusing
2. Who you think this is *really* for (be specific — not "students" but "a second-year philosophy student writing an essay on free will")
3. 3 things you'd want to tell a friend about it
4. 3 topics that made particularly compelling maps

## Day 2: Content Creation — Build the Showcase Maps

Today you become a content factory. The strategy is "show, don't tell" — every piece of marketing is anchored by a real map that demonstrates the tool's value.

### Morning — Create 3 "Hero Maps" (1 hour each)

Each map should be visually impressive (4+ levels deep, multiple branches) and on a topic that a specific audience cares about.

**Map 1: The Hot Take** (for social media)
- Pick something people are arguing about *right now*
- Map both sides thoroughly so neither camp can dismiss it
- Examples: "Is AI-generated art real art?", "Should universities ban ChatGPT?", "Remote work vs office — who's actually right?"

**Map 2: The Curriculum Tie-In** (for educators)
- Pick a topic from a common school/university syllabus
- Show how the tool helps students explore it more deeply than a textbook
- Examples: "Was the dropping of the atomic bomb justified?", "Utilitarianism vs deontological ethics", "Nature vs nurture"

**Map 3: The Rabbit Hole** (for curious minds / knowledge workers)
- Pick something fascinating and niche that rewards going deep
- Use deep dive and related ideas liberally
- Examples: "The simulation hypothesis", "Why do we dream?", "The history of zero"

### Afternoon — Capture the Content

For each map:
- [ ] **Screenshot** the full graph view (zoomed out to show structure) — this is your hero image
- [ ] **Screenshot** 2-3 interesting individual nodes (zoom in on a particularly good thesis/antithesis pair, a surprising synthesis, etc.)
- [ ] **Screen-record a 60-second walkthrough** of one map being built (use QuickTime on Mac: File → New Screen Recording). Show the branching happening in real time. No audio needed yet.
- [ ] **Write a 2-3 sentence hook** for each map. Format: "[Provocative question or claim]. I mapped out every argument on both sides. Here's what I found → [link]"
- [ ] **Export each map as Markdown** — this becomes a blog post draft

### Deliverable

- 3 polished maps live on MuDG (public links)
- 9+ screenshots organised in a folder
- 1-3 screen recordings
- 3 written hooks ready to post

## Day 3: Distribution — Get It In Front of People

You have content. Now you put it where the people are. Today is about seeding, not going viral. Consistent presence > one lucky post.

### Morning — Set Up Channels & Seed Posts

**Reddit (highest priority — this is where curious people live)**
- [ ] Post Map 1 (The Hot Take) to the most relevant subreddit for that topic. Use a title format like: *"I mapped out every argument for and against [X] using an AI argument mapping tool — here's the full breakdown"*
  - Good subreddits: `r/philosophy`, `r/ArtificialIntelligence`, `r/changemyview`, `r/InternetIsBeautiful`, `r/dataisbeautiful`, `r/coolguides`, or the specific subreddit for your topic
  - **Read each subreddit's rules before posting.** Some ban self-promotion. Frame it as sharing something interesting, not advertising.
- [ ] Post Map 3 (The Rabbit Hole) to `r/PKM` (Personal Knowledge Management) or `r/ObsidianMD` or `r/productivity` — frame it as a thinking tool, not a debate tool

**X / Twitter**
- [ ] Post a thread using Map 1:
  - Tweet 1: The hook (provocative claim + screenshot of the full graph)
  - Tweet 2-4: Screenshots of the best thesis/antithesis pairs with brief commentary
  - Tweet 5: "Built with MuDG — it maps arguments so you can see both sides. Free to try → [link]"
- [ ] Tag any public figures or accounts relevant to the topic (respectfully, not spammy)

**LinkedIn (for the education / professional angle)**
- [ ] Post about Map 2 (The Curriculum Tie-In) with an education angle: *"What if students could see the structure of an argument, not just read about it?"*
- [ ] Tag any educator contacts

### Afternoon — Community Engagement & Niche Outreach

- [ ] **Find 5 relevant Discord servers** (philosophy, debate, AI, education, PKM/note-taking) — join them, introduce yourself naturally, and share a map *only when it's genuinely relevant to an ongoing conversation*. Do not spam.
- [ ] **Find 3 relevant YouTube creators or bloggers** who cover critical thinking, philosophy, study tools, or AI tools — note their contact info and what kind of content they make. Don't reach out yet (that's Day 4).
- [ ] **Respond to every single comment** on your Reddit/Twitter posts. Engagement in the first 2 hours is critical for algorithmic visibility. Be genuine, answer questions, take feedback seriously.

### Deliverable

- 2+ Reddit posts live
- 1 Twitter/X thread live
- 1 LinkedIn post live
- A list of 5 Discord servers joined
- A list of 3 potential creator/blogger contacts
- All comments responded to

## Day 4: Outreach, Iteration & Setting Up the Flywheel

Today is about learning from what happened on Day 3, doing direct outreach, and building a repeatable system.

### Morning — Analyse & Iterate

- [ ] **Check metrics on all Day 3 posts** — views, upvotes, comments, click-throughs. Write down:
  - Which post got the most engagement? Why do you think?
  - What did people say in the comments? Any recurring questions or objections?
  - Did anyone actually sign up and create a map? (Check if there are new public maps on the site)
- [ ] **Create a "FAQ / Objection Handling" doc** based on the comments you received. Common ones will likely be:
  - "How is this different from ChatGPT?" → It's not a chat, it's a map. You see the *structure* of the argument, not just a wall of text. You can branch, challenge, and synthesise.
  - "Is this just for philosophy?" → No — it works for any topic. Policy analysis, essay planning, research exploration, decision-making.
  - "Can I use it for [X]?" → Probably yes. Make a quick map to demonstrate.
- [ ] **Build 1 new map** based on whatever got the most traction or the most interesting comment from Day 3. This shows you're listening and responding to your audience.

### Afternoon — Direct Outreach & The Repeatable System

**Creator/Blogger Outreach**
- [ ] Write a short, personalised email or DM to the 3 creators/bloggers you identified on Day 3. Template:

  > Hi [Name], I've been following your content on [specific thing they cover]. I'm working with a tool called MuDG that maps out arguments visually using AI — I think it overlaps with what your audience cares about. I made this map on [topic relevant to their content]: [link]. Would love to hear what you think, and happy to make a custom map on any topic you'd find interesting. No pressure at all — just thought you'd find it genuinely cool.

  **Key rules:** Be brief. Be specific about *their* work. Offer value (a custom map). Don't beg. Follow up once after 5 days, then drop it.

**Education Outreach**
- [ ] Find 3-5 university lecturers or school teachers who teach critical thinking, philosophy, or debate (check university department pages, education Twitter, P4C networks). Send a similar personalised note, but angle it as: *"a free tool that helps students visualise argument structure."*

**Set Up the Repeatable Weekly Cadence**
- [ ] Create a simple content calendar (Google Sheet or Notion) with this weekly rhythm:

  | Day | Activity |
  |---|---|
  | Monday | Create 1 new "Map of the Week" on a trending or evergreen topic |
  | Tuesday | Write hook text + capture screenshots |
  | Wednesday | Post to Reddit + Twitter |
  | Thursday | Post to LinkedIn + 1 niche community (Discord/forum) |
  | Friday | Respond to all comments, note what worked, prep next week's topic |

- [ ] **Brainstorm a list of 10 future map topics** — mix of trending, evergreen, and niche. Keep a running list that you add to whenever you see an interesting debate or question online.

### Deliverable

- Analytics summary from Day 3 posts
- FAQ / Objection Handling doc
- 1 new map built based on audience feedback
- 3 outreach messages sent to creators/bloggers
- 3-5 outreach messages sent to educators
- Content calendar set up with 10 future topic ideas

## Quick Reference — What Good MuDG Content Looks Like

**The hook formula:**
> [Surprising claim or question] + [I mapped it / I broke down every argument] + [Here's what I found] + [Link]

**The screenshot formula:**
- Wide shot of the full graph (shows complexity and structure)
- Close-up of a thesis ↔ antithesis pair (shows the tool generating real arguments)
- Close-up of a synthesis node (shows the tool resolving tensions)

**What to emphasise vs. what to avoid:**

| ✅ Emphasise | ❌ Avoid |
|---|---|
| "See the shape of the argument" | "AI generates text" |
| "Explore both sides" | "It writes essays for you" |
| "Your thinking, made visible" | Generic AI hype |
| "Collaborative — build maps together" | "Replaces human thinking" |
| Specific, impressive examples | Vague feature lists |

*Good luck — the most important thing in the first 4 days is to genuinely understand and love the product. If you find it useful yourself, selling it to others becomes natural. If something confuses or frustrates you, write it down — that's a UX insight worth its weight in gold.*
