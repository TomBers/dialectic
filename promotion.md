This is a great strategy. "Show, don't tell" is the best marketing for a visual tool like MuDG. Since you have an "AI-augmented" tool, you can produce high-quality content faster than a standard blogger.

Here is a 5-day "Content & Distribution" plan designed to be manageable but high-impact.

### The Daily Routine (Repeat M-F)
1.  **Morning (1 hour):** Create the "Map of the Day" using MuDG.
2.  **Mid-Day (30 mins):** Capture a screenshot/video and write the "Hook" text.
3.  **Afternoon (30 mins):** Post to **one** specific high-traffic community and **two** social channels.
4.  **Evening (15 mins):** Reply to comments. **Do not ghost your own threads.**

### Monday: The "Meta" Argument
Target the productivity/knowledge management crowd. They love tools for thinking.

*   **The Big Idea:** **"Why Linear Chat is Failing Us"** (or "The limits of text-based debate").
*   **The Angle:** Use MuDG to map out the pros/cons of Twitter/Discord vs. Structured mapping. It demonstrates the tool's value *by discussing the tool's value*.
*   **Where to Post:**
    *   **Hacker News:** Use the title `Show HN: MuDG – I built a tool to map arguments because chat is too messy`.
    *   **Reddit:** `r/PKM` (Personal Knowledge Management), `r/ObsidianMD` (they love graph views), or `r/InternetIsBeautiful`.

### Tuesday: The "Hot Topic" (Newsjacking)
Piggyback on something people are already angry or excited about.

*   **The Big Idea:** Pick a current AI debate (e.g., **"e/acc vs. AI Safety"**) or a current tech policy debate.
*   **The Angle:** Don't take a side. Map the *entire* battlefield. "I used AI to map out every argument in the AI Safety debate so you don't have to read 1,000 tweets."
*   **Where to Post:**
    *   **X (Twitter):** Tag the loud voices in that debate (respectfully). "I mapped your argument with @opponent's argument here..."
    *   **Reddit:** `r/Singularity` or `r/ArtificialInteligence`.

### Wednesday: The "Deep Philosophy" (Credibility)
Show that the tool handles complexity and nuance.

*   **The Big Idea:** A classic paradox (e.g., **"The Simulation Hypothesis"** or **"Free Will vs. Determinism"**).
*   **The Angle:** "Visualizing the branching logic of the Simulation Theory." Make it look beautiful and dense.
*   **Where to Post:**
    *   **Reddit:** `r/Philosophy` (check rules first), `r/VisualLearning`.
    *   **Discord:** Find philosophy or debate discord servers.

### Thursday: The "Pop Culture" Analysis (Accessibility)
Make it fun. Lower the barrier to entry.

*   **The Big Idea:** Analyze the conflict in a popular movie/show (e.g., **"Paul Atreides: Hero or Villain? (Dune)"** or a Breakdown of a complex plot).
*   **The Angle:** "I couldn't keep track of the factions in [Movie], so I mapped them."
*   **Where to Post:**
    *   **Reddit:** `r/Movies`, `r/FanTheories`, or the specific subreddit for that fandom (e.g., `r/Dune`).
    *   **X (Twitter):** Use relevant hashtags.

### Friday: The "Collaborative Challenge" (Engagement)
Shift from "Look at what I made" to "Come help me."

*   **The Big Idea:** An unfinished map of **"The Future of Work."**
*   **The Angle:** leave the leaf nodes open-ended. "I've mapped the basics, but I need experts to fill in the 'Remote Work' branch. Link in comments to edit."
*   **Where to Post:**
    *   **LinkedIn:** This is a professional topic. "I'm experimenting with a new way to brainstorm..."
    *   **IndieHackers:** "How I'm using my own tool to plan the future."
