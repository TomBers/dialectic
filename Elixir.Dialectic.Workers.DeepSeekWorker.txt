A
 "
Body
 without
 Org
ans
"
 (
B
w
O
)
 is
 a
 concept
 from
 Gilles
 Dele
uze
 and
 F
él
ix
 Gu
att
ari
's
 philosophy
,
 particularly
 in
 *
A
 Thousand

aus
*.
 It
 refers
 to
 a
 state
 of
 the
 body
 that
 res
ists
 fixed
 organization
,
 hierarchy
,
 or
 function
.
 Instead
 of
 being
 structured
 by
 societal
 norms
 or
 biological
 determin
ism
,
 the
 B
w
O
 is
 a
 fluid
,
 open
 field
 of
 potential
ities
,
 intensities
,
 and
 connections
.
 It
’
s
 not
 a
 literal
 organ
less
 body
 but
 a
 metaphor
 for
 escaping
 rigid
 systems
 and
 embracing
 experimentation
,
 desire
,
 and
 becoming
.
 Think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 body
 freed
 from
 imposed
 constraints
,
 open
 to
 new
 ways
 of
 existing
 and
 relating
.
