## Ordinary-language philosophy: meaning rooted in use\n\n- Short answer: Ordinary-language philosophy asks how words get their meaning from everyday use, not from abstract definitions or inner mental representations. It treats linguistic meaning as a product of social practice and the rules governing actual language use, clarified through careful attention to ordinary speech.\n\n### Deep dive\n- Foundations (optional): Key terms—ordinary language philosophy, language game, rule-following, public language. Assumptions: meaning arises from how words function in concrete situations, within communities of speakers.\n\n- Core explanation: Meanings are not fixed by mental pictures or formal semantics; they emerge from how language is employed in real practices (talk, inquiry, social interaction). Philosophical puzzles often dissolve when we examine ordinary uses and the grammar of language in context. This approach contrasts with purely conceptual analyses or private-language fantasies: meaning presupposes shared criteria and public standards.\n\n- Mechanism (example): Consider the word “promise.” Its meaning includes the commitment, the expectation of action, and the social import of making a commitment. The force of “I promise”## depends on social practices—relying on trust, Ordinary-language philosophy\n\n expectations,- Short answer: Ordinary-language philosophy analyzes how words are actually used in daily speech to dissolve philosophical confusions and the.
