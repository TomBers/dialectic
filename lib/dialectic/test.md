## Pro argument title\n- Antifragile systems gain net benefit from disorder due to built-in optionality and adaptive mechanisms.\n\n### Deep dive\n- Core explanation: Optionality enables positive leverage under stress by exposing only a subset of outcomes; this converts shocks into favorable opportunities when exercised. Redundancy and buffering preserve or enhance performance during perturbations, preventing collapse. Adaptive feedback loops learn from perturbations, updating strategies toward higher performance. Assumptions include access to actionable optionality and learning capability; applicability spans domains with controllable adjustments and feedback-driven improvement.\n\n- Nuance:\n - Edge case: When shocks exhaust resources or overwhelm buffers, optionality may fail to yield gains.\n - Edge case: Misaligned incentives can convert potential gains into losses despite adaptive mechanisms.
