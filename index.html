                            This screenshot is a graph exploring ethics. As we
                            can see we have several approaches to ethical
                            decision making. We can explore any path through the
                            idea, whatever approach seems most interesting at
                            the time.

                        <p>
                            We can come back whenever we want to other paths and
                            pick up where we left off. Now we can explore each
                            approach in detail, asking for an example, and
                            branching through between the Pros and Cons.

                            from earlier decisions.

                            The interface has been designed from the ground up
                            to be simple, clean and fast. We do not track users
                            or have advertising; your data is not sold to 3rd
                            parties.

                            We aim to have a non-distracting experience. No ads,
                            or interruptions. Allowing you to focus on the
                            content of what you are thinking about; a more
                            reflective environment.

                        <p>
                            We have built the interface to allow quick
                            navigation, with keyboard and mouse controls that
                            aim to provide a seamless experience of moving

                    <h2>About MuDG</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="about-content">
                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        MuDG began with a simple observation: the revolutionary
                        potential of large language models for education remains
                        largely untapped. While today's AI assistants offer
                        impressive capabilities, they exist primarily as
                        isolated, ephemeral exchanges. Our vision is to
                        transform these interactions into persistent, evolving
                        knowledge structures that grow richer with each
                        exploration.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Knowledge Graph Paradigm</h3>
                    <p>
                        At MuDG, we believe the future of learning isn't
                        linear—it's networked. Traditional educational paths
                        often follow predetermined sequences, but human
                        curiosity rarely operates this way. We naturally branch,
                        connect, and integrate ideas across domains. Our
                        knowledge graph approach mirrors this natural thought
                        process, allowing learners to move freely between
                        concepts while maintaining coherent connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each node in a MuDG graph represents a discrete concept,
                        question, or insight. Unlike traditional learning
                        materials that might bury important connections in
                        paragraphs of text, our graph structure makes
                        relationships explicit and navigable. This visualization
                        of knowledge helps learners identify patterns and
                        connections they might otherwise miss.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Collaborative Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>
                        MuDG combines the analytical power of language models
                        with the creative, contextual understanding of human
                        minds. While AI excels at retrieving and synthesizing
                        information across vast knowledge domains, humans excel
                        at determining relevance, identifying novel connections,
                        and applying insights to real-world contexts. By
                        designing a platform where these complementary
                        intelligences work together, we create learning
                        experiences greater than either could produce alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Collaboration extends beyond the human-AI relationship
                        to encompass peer-to-peer learning as well. When
                        multiple users explore and expand a knowledge graph
                        together, they contribute diverse perspectives and
                        expertise. This multiplayer aspect transforms learning
                        from a solitary activity into a social one, where
                        discovery is shared and insights are collectively
                        refined.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Technical Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our technical approach is guided by several core
                        principles:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Speed matters.</strong> Cognitive flow is
                            easily disrupted by technical friction. We've
                            optimized every aspect of the interface to minimize
                            latency and maximize responsiveness.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Simplicity enables depth.</strong> Complex
                            ideas don't require complex interfaces. By
                            eliminating unnecessary elements and focusing on
                            conceptual clarity, we allow deeper engagement with
                            content.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Privacy is foundational.</strong> Learning
                            requires experimentation and vulnerability. We've
                            designed a platform where users can explore ideas
                            freely without concerns about data harvesting or
                            surveillance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Persistence creates value.</strong> Unlike
                            ephemeral chats that disappear, MuDG knowledge
                            graphs persist, accumulating value over time as they
                            grow and connect.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Future of MuDG</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're just beginning our journey to reimagine how humans
                        and AI can learn together. Future developments will
                        include specialized tools for educators, expanded
                        visualization options, and deeper integration
                        capabilities with existing knowledge bases and learning
                        resources. Our north star remains constant: creating the
                        most effective collaborative learning environment
                        possible, where the boundaries between teaching and
                        learning blur, and where knowledge isn't just consumed
                        but actively constructed.
