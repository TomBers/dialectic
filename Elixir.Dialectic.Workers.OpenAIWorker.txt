 is
 a
 book
 by
 Gilles
 De

ari
 that
 critiques
 traditional
 psycho
analy
tic
 approaches
,
 particularly
 the
 O
ed
ip
us
 complex
,
 and
 proposes
 a
 new
 understanding
 of
 desire
 and
 capitalism
.
 They
 argue
 that
 desire
 is
 productive
 and
 liber
ating
,
 rather
 than
 re
pressive
,
 and
 that
 capitalism
 manip
ulates
 desire
 for
 control
.
 They
 advocate
 for
 a
 re
thinking
 of
 social
 structures
 and
 power
 dynamics
 to
 allow
 for
 more
 creative
 and
 satisfying
 forms
 of
 existence
.
